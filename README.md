Eclipse + Google C++ testing
=============

A setup which should work on the Kepler (8.3) version of Eclipse. 
You will need to have Google C++ Testing framework already installed. 
Please listen to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukF3kUH1kxM).
In my case, I used the MingwC++ compiler ecosystem to get it to build and compile eventually.

There is also native support in Eclipse for other testing frameworks (including Boost Test runner). 
To set this up, read [this](http://feelings-erased.blogspot.in/2012/07/eclipse-juno-has-landed-with-unit.html) and [this](http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/512946/).
