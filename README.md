Eclipse + Google C++ testing
=============

A setup which should work in the Kepler (8.3) version of Eclipse. 
You will need to have Google C++ Testing framework already installed. 
Please review this [video][Eclipse youTube] for more details.

In my case, I used the Cygwin [ToolChain](img/ToolChain.PNG) to get it to compile, build and run eventually.

Here's a screen shot of the Test Driven Development (TDD) setup.

Notice the two failing tests in the Unit Testing support tab C/C++ Unit next to Console). There is also native support in Eclipse for other testing frameworks (including Boost Test runner).
To set this up, read [this](http://feelings-erased.blogspot.in/2012/07/eclipse-juno-has-landed-with-unit.html) and [this](http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/512946/).
