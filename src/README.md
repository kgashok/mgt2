# Bob

Bob is a [lackadaisical][lazy] teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
- Bob answers **'Sure.'** if you ask him a question.
- He answers **'Woah, just calm down!'** if you yell at him.
- He says **'Fine. Be that way!'** if you address him without actually saying anything.
- He answers **'Whatever.'** to anything else.

## Instructions

Run the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the first test to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make that pass as well. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to submit.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as __readable__ and __expressive__ as you can make it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
